Steps for setting up and running the App:
-----------------------------------------

1. Import the project into your favourite IDE.

2. Install the dependencies -> click on Project -> Clean and Build.

3. Assuming there are no errors at the parent project level -> we will move onto setting up our DB connection, preferably MySQL

4. Assuming you have MySQL and MySQL Client installed.

5. Set up a new connection 	-> give any name ex. "LocalInstance"
							-> setup a user name -> currently set to root
							-> setup a password -> currently set to root
							
6. Create a new Schema for your DB.

7. Last step, is to go to application.properties file 
							-> go to -> spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/----------? -> Enter your DB Schema name in place of blank space -> currently set to user_devl1
							-> go to -> spring.datasource.username=root    			-> put your username
							-> go to -> spring.datasource.password=root 			-> put your password
							
							
Your DB connection is ready for setup.


Rest, creation of the tables and other things will be taken care by Spring Boot Framework.
